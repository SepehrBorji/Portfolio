                This project is a vending machine made with VHDL code and the DE2-115 Altera FPGA board. 
                Components were created and unit tested in ModelSim and the entire project was tested and 
                interfaced to the board using Quartus.
            </p>
            <h3>Making Components</h3>
            <p>
                This project was all about making small components and later combining them into a larger structure. 
                Initially I worked on a few components, and I thought the coolest one was this component that converted 
                an 8-bit binary input to a set of 3 4-bit binary-coded-decimal (BCD) values. For example, let’s assume you want to 
                represent 246 cents, in binary this is 1111 0110. The BCD output we’d get from this is 0010 0100 0110. 
            </p>
            <h3>Testing and Waveforms</h3>
            <p>
                My main responsibility in this group project was testing the individual components. This includes components 
                that keep track of how many coins have been inserted, what the change due to the customer is, what price the 
                user would like to program for a certain product, and more.
                <br> <br>
                The testing would happen in ModelSim, where after 
                creating our components, I’d prepare a testbench, which is basically a component/entity that tests the component 
                we really need. Essentially, the testbenches would mess around with inputs to the components/device we want to test, 
                and a waveform shows us the outputs. 
                From here, I’m able to look over the waveform and make sure that the logic 
                introduced by the component is correct. Remember the BCD component I talked about? Here is the waveform, and you can 
                check that an input of 1111 0110 yields an output of 0010 0100 0110, both of which represent the number 246.
